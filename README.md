# FrontPlaster JS 

A tiny javascript library that allows you to structure your frontend code and gives you access to useful functions.

This library does not dot everything, the idea is to have a very simple library in its structure in order to make it evolve easily. 
You can upgrade it yourself by simply adding the features you want. 
The general idea of the project is to provide to everyone simple functions written in javascript that can be used in the client part of a site. 
No large libraries like React VuJs or JQuery are required, the code is as simple as possible to use and read, is written in pure Javascript. 

The sources are usually written with the latest Ecmascript version  and then transposed with Babel for maximum compatibility with Firefox and Chrome (Internet Explorer is not considered compatible)

## Getting Started

For the moment there is no official way to install the library, you can simply clone the project and get the file ``` dist/frontplaster.js ```.
You can include this file like any other JS file, no dependency is necessary.
